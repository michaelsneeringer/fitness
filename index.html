                <h2>Stop. Before you go any further, read this.</h2>
                <p>You've tried the latest diet -- keto, paleo, intermittent fasting -- and maybe it worked for a few weeks before life got in the way. You've started workout programs that felt great on day one and impossible by week three. You've bought supplements, followed influencers, and still ended up right back where you started.</p>
                <p>You're tired of putting in effort and seeing nothing stick. Tired of plans that demand hours at the gym or meal-prepping like it's a second job. Tired of conflicting advice where one expert says one thing and the next says the opposite. And after all this, you don't blame the bad advice -- you blame yourself. You think you failed because you lacked discipline.</p>
                <p>This site is for you if you want to be healthy and live longer (and, let's be honest, also look good), you want something simple that actually works instead of the latest fad, you want advice grounded in science rather than hype, and -- this one is really important -- you're genuinely open to doing something different this time.</p>

                <p>So you're still reading. Good. Before you dive in, here's what this program actually looks like in practice -- because you deserve to know what you might be signing up for.</p>

                        <p>The commitment is smaller than you think. About <strong>one hour per week</strong> of intense exercise and roughly 90 minutes per week of low-intensity exercise like walking on an incline or easy cycling. No two-a-days, no six-day splits, no living at the gym.</p>

                        <p>They will come slowly. That's not a warning -- it's a feature. You won't see dramatic changes in a week, but you will see <strong>consistent, measurable progress month after month</strong>. Small gains will compound. Six months from now, the numbers will speak for themselves.</p>
