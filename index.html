                <h2>Stop. Before you go any further, read this.</h2>
                <p>You've tried the latest diet -- keto, paleo, intermittent fasting -- and maybe it worked for a few weeks before life got in the way. You've started workout programs that felt great on day one and impossible by week three. You've bought supplements, followed influencers, and still ended up right back where you started.</p>
                <p>You're tired of putting in effort and seeing nothing stick. Tired of plans that demand hours at the gym or meal-prepping like it's a second job. Tired of conflicting advice where one expert says one thing and the next says the opposite. And after all this, you don't blame the bad advice -- you blame yourself. You think you failed because you lacked discipline.</p>
                <p>This site is for you if you want to be healthy and live longer (and, let's be honest, also look good), you want something simple that actually works instead of the latest fad, you want advice grounded in science rather than hype, and -- this one is really important -- you're genuinely open to doing something different this time.</p>

        <!-- Our Philosophy -->

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Five metrics, not fifty:</strong> Strength, VO2 max, body fat, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure -- these are the numbers that actually predict how long and how well you'll live</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimum effective dose:</strong> One hour of intense training and 90 minutes of easy cardio per week -- because a program you'll actually follow beats a perfect program you won't</li>
                    <li><strong>Research over rhetoric:</strong> Every recommendation on this site is grounded in peer-reviewed science, not influencer wisdom or supplement marketing</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability over speed:</strong> No crash diets, no extreme protocols -- just a straightforward approach designed to work for years, not weeks</li>
                    <li><strong>Measure what matters:</strong> Track your progress with real data so you can see what's working, catch what isn't, and make adjustments based on evidence instead of feelings</li>

        <!-- What You Can Expect -->
        <section class="content-section" style="padding: var(--spacing-lg) 0;">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
                <p>So you're still reading. Good. Before you dive in, here's what this program actually looks like in practice -- because you deserve to know what you might be signing up for.</p>

                <p>The training commitment is smaller than you think. You'll spend about one hour per week on intense exercise -- strength training and high-intensity cardio -- and roughly 90 minutes per week on low-intensity exercise like walking on an incline or easy cycling. That's it. No two-a-days, no six-day splits, no living at the gym.</p>

                <p>The diet doesn't require you to count calories, eliminate food groups, or say goodbye to your favorite foods. You won't be eating boiled chicken and broccoli out of tupperware, unless you like that sort of thing. You'll learn a sustainable approach that works with your life, not against it.</p>

                <p>Results will come slowly. That's not a warning -- it's a feature. You won't see dramatic changes in a week, but you will see consistent, measurable progress month after month. Small gains will compound. Six months from now, the numbers will tell a story that's hard to argue with.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Getting Started</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">A simple, three-step approach to improving your health -- no fads, no gimmicks, just science.</p>

                <div class="getting-started-steps">
                    <div class="getting-started-step">
                        <div class="step-number">1</div>
                        <h3>Identify the Metrics That Matter</h3>
                        <p>Learn which five health metrics are backed by decades of research as the strongest predictors of longevity and quality of life. These aren't vanity numbers or arbitrary benchmarks -- they're the biomarkers that consistently show up in large-scale studies on healthspan and mortality. Understanding what to measure is the first step toward knowing where you actually stand. Once you have that baseline, everything else has a clear direction.</p>

                        <div class="step-number">2</div>
                        <h3>Follow a Simple, Evidence-Based Plan</h3>
                        <p>Each metric has a straightforward, science-backed protocol to improve it. No complicated programs, no expensive supplements -- just the methods that the research shows actually move the needle. The plans are designed to fit into a normal life, not take it over. You'll know exactly what to do, why it works, and how little time it actually requires.</p>

                        <h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
                        <p>Use practical tools and templates to measure your progress over time. Consistent tracking turns vague feelings into concrete data, so you always know whether your approach is working. You'll have a clear schedule for when to test each metric and simple methods to record the results. What gets measured gets managed -- and what gets managed gets better.</p>
