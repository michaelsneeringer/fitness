        <section class="site-intro">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Stop. Before You Go Any Further, Read This.</h2>
                <p>You've been here before. You've tried the latest diet -- keto, paleo, high-protein, intermittent fasting -- and maybe it worked for a few weeks before life got in the way. You've started workout programs that felt great on day one and impossible by week three. You've bought supplements, downloaded apps, followed influencers, and still ended up right back where you started.</p>
                <p>You're tired. Not just physically -- though that too -- but tired of putting in effort and seeing nothing stick. Tired of plans that demand several hours a week at the gym or meal-prepping like it's a second job. Tired of conflicting advice where one expert says one thing and the next says the opposite.</p>

                <h3>This site is for you if:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You want to actually be healthy and live longer (and, let's be honest, also look good)</li>
                    <li>You want something simple that works -- not the latest fad</li>
                    <li>You want advice grounded in evidence and science, not hype</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Here's how this site is organized:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Health Metrics That Matter</strong> -- The handful of numbers that science has proven actually predict your longevity and quality of life.</li>
                    <li><strong>How To Get Strong and Fit</strong> -- Practical, evidence-based ways to move the needle on those metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Markers</strong> -- Additional biomarkers worth paying attention to.</li>
                    <li><strong>What Doesn't Work</strong> -- The popular advice you can safely ignore. Some of this will be controversial.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why do most diet and exercise plans fail?</strong> Because they're too hard to stick with. They're too time-consuming, too taxing, or too monotonous. This site focuses on the minimum effective dose -- the simplest changes that actually make a measurable difference.</p>

            <h2>Why These Metrics?</h2>
            <p>The fitness industry is full of noise: fad diets, miracle supplements, and quick fixes that promise results but fail to deliver. This site cuts through the confusion by focusing on what the science actually shows matters for your health.</p>
            <p>The following five metrics are backed by decades of research demonstrating their direct impact on longevity, disease prevention, and quality of life.</p>

                        <p>Muscular strength is one of the strongest predictors of longevity and metabolic health. Strong muscles protect against injury, maintain bone density, and improve metabolic function.</p>
