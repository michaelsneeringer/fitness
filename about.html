                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>The fitness industry is saturated with misinformation, fad diets, and quick-fix solutions. Every week there's a new superfood, miracle supplement, or diet trend promising to revolutionize your health.</p>

                <p>This site exists to cut through the noise and focus on what the scientific evidence actually shows matters for long-term health and longevity.</p>

                <p>We believe in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evidence over anecdote:</strong> Peer-reviewed research trumps testimonials</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundamentals over fads:</strong> The basics work better than tricks and hacks</li>
                    <li><strong>Metrics over aesthetics:</strong> Health markers predict longevity better than appearance</li>
                    <li><strong>Honesty over hype:</strong> No magic pills, no shortcuts, no nonsense</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility over complexity:</strong> Simple, actionable information anyone can use</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why These Five Metrics?</h2>
                <p>After reviewing decades of research on health, longevity, and disease prevention, five metrics consistently emerge as the most predictive of long-term health outcomes:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Strength</strong> - Predicts all-cause mortality, maintains independence, protects against metabolic disease</li>
                    <li><strong>VO2 Max</strong> - The gold standard for cardiovascular fitness and mortality risk</li>
                    <li><strong>LDL Cholesterol</strong> - The primary driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood Pressure</strong> - A major risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage</strong> - More relevant than body weight for metabolic health and disease risk</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These aren't the only health metrics that matter, but they represent the most impactful areas where lifestyle interventions can make measurable differences in health span and lifespan.</p>
