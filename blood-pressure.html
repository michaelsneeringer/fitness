                <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>Blood pressure management is one of the most impactful things you can do for long-term health. The following evidence-based strategies can meaningfully reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Work with your healthcare provider to find the right approach for you.</p>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p><strong>Follow the DASH diet:</strong> The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy while limiting saturated fat and added sugars. The DASH diet alone can lower systolic blood pressure by 8-14 mmHg.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reduce sodium intake:</strong> Aim for less than 2,300mg per day (ideally under 1,500mg for those with hypertension). Reducing sodium can lower systolic blood pressure by 5-6 mmHg. Read labels carefully — most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Increase potassium intake:</strong> Aim for 3,500-5,000mg per day from foods like bananas, potatoes, spinach, beans, and avocados. Potassium helps counterbalance the effects of sodium on blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> No more than 1 drink per day for women and 2 for men. Reducing heavy alcohol consumption can lower systolic blood pressure by 2-4 mmHg.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Exercise</h3>
                    <p><strong>Aerobic exercise:</strong> 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming). Regular aerobic exercise can reduce systolic blood pressure by 5-8 mmHg.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resistance training:</strong> 2-3 sessions per week of moderate-intensity resistance training. Dynamic resistance exercise can lower systolic blood pressure by 4-5 mmHg. Avoid heavy isometric exercises if blood pressure is uncontrolled.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Blood pressure reductions from exercise are maintained only with continued activity. The effects diminish within weeks of stopping.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACE inhibitors:</strong> (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril) — Block the enzyme that narrows blood vessels. First-line treatment, especially for patients with diabetes or kidney disease.</p>
                    <p><strong>ARBs:</strong> (losartan, valsartan, olmesartan) — Block angiotensin receptors to relax blood vessels. Often used when ACE inhibitors cause side effects like a dry cough.</p>
                    <p><strong>Calcium channel blockers:</strong> (amlodipine, nifedipine) — Relax blood vessel walls by preventing calcium from entering muscle cells. Effective as first-line therapy, especially in older adults.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thiazide diuretics:</strong> (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) — Reduce blood volume by increasing urinary output. Often used in combination with other medications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Most patients with stage 2 hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) will need two or more medications to reach target blood pressure. Medication decisions should be individualized with your physician.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                    <p><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Losing even 5-10 pounds can lower blood pressure. For every 1 kg of weight lost, blood pressure drops by approximately 1 mmHg.</p>
                    <p><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress contributes to sustained blood pressure elevation. Evidence-based techniques include mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep apnea is a common and underdiagnosed cause of resistant hypertension — talk to your doctor if you snore heavily or feel unrested.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> While smoking causes acute blood pressure spikes, the greater risk is accelerated arterial damage. Quitting smoking is one of the single best things you can do for cardiovascular health.</p>
