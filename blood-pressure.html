                <h2>The Science</h2>
                <p>Blood pressure is one of the most well-studied and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death. The relationship between elevated blood pressure and adverse health outcomes is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.</p>

                    <h3>The Studies</h3>
                    <p>Hypertension is called "the silent killer" for good reason: it causes progressive damage to the heart, brain, kidneys, and blood vessels for years without any noticeable symptoms. The research on blood pressure and mortality is extensive and unequivocal.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Log-Linear Relationship with Mortality:</strong> The Prospective Studies Collaboration analyzed individual data from over 1 million adults in 61 prospective studies and found a continuous, log-linear relationship between blood pressure and vascular mortality, starting from levels as low as 115/75 mmHg. Each 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (or 10 mmHg in diastolic) was associated with a doubling of cardiovascular death risk across all age groups from 40 to 89.<sup>[1]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Lowering Blood Pressure Prevents Events:</strong> Ettehad et al. (2016) published a comprehensive meta-analysis in The Lancet covering 123 studies and over 600,000 participants. They found that every 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, heart failure by 28%, stroke by 27%, and all-cause mortality by 13%. These benefits were consistent regardless of starting blood pressure or the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Intensive Control Saves Lives:</strong> The landmark SPRINT trial randomized over 9,300 adults with hypertension to either intensive treatment (target systolic &lt;120 mmHg) or standard treatment (target &lt;140 mmHg). The trial was stopped early because the intensive treatment group showed a 25% reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality. These results fundamentally shifted clinical guidelines toward more aggressive blood pressure targets.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Hypertension is Pervasive and Undertreated:</strong> The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines estimate that nearly half of American adults have hypertension (defined as blood pressure &ge;130/80 mmHg). Of those, only about 1 in 4 have their blood pressure under control. This represents one of the largest modifiable risk factors in public health -- and one of the most neglected.<sup>[4]</sup></li>

        <!-- HOW TO MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE -->

                    <h3>How to Measure Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p>Blood pressure monitors are inexpensive, widely available, and easy to use at home. You don't need to wait for a doctor's visit to know your numbers. A quality automatic upper-arm cuff monitor can be purchased for $30-60 and will give you reliable readings for years.</p>
                    <p>Proper technique matters. Incorrect positioning or timing can produce readings that are off by 10-20 mmHg, which is enough to misclassify your blood pressure category entirely. Follow this protocol:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Test upon waking:</strong> Take your blood pressure first thing in the morning, before coffee, food, or exercise. Morning readings tend to be the most consistent and clinically meaningful.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sit correctly:</strong> Sit upright in a chair with a back support. Place your feet flat on the floor with your legs uncrossed. Crossing your legs can raise systolic blood pressure by 2-8 mmHg.</li>
                        <li><strong>Position the cuff at heart level:</strong> The cuff should be on your upper arm at the level of your heart. Rest your arm on a nearby armrest or table so the cuff is naturally at heart-level height. A cuff that is too high or too low will produce inaccurate readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Take 3 measurements:</strong> Take three consecutive readings, waiting about 1 minute between each. Discard the first reading (which tends to be elevated) and average the second and third readings. This gives you the most reliable result.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test daily or weekly:</strong> Consistency is more important than frequency. Whether you test daily or a few times per week, tracking your readings over time will reveal your true blood pressure pattern and show whether your interventions are working.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Record your numbers.</strong> Write down each reading with the date and time, or use an app to track them. Bring your log to your doctor's appointments -- home readings are often more representative of your actual blood pressure than office readings, which can be artificially elevated by "white coat" anxiety.</p>

                <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>Blood pressure management is one of the most impactful things you can do for long-term health. The following evidence-based strategies can meaningfully reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Work with your healthcare provider to find the right approach for you.</p>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p><strong>Follow the DASH diet:</strong> The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy while limiting saturated fat and added sugars. The DASH diet alone can lower systolic blood pressure by 8-14 mmHg.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reduce sodium intake:</strong> Aim for less than 2,300mg per day (ideally under 1,500mg for those with hypertension). Reducing sodium can lower systolic blood pressure by 5-6 mmHg. Read labels carefully — most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Increase potassium intake:</strong> Aim for 3,500-5,000mg per day from foods like bananas, potatoes, spinach, beans, and avocados. Potassium helps counterbalance the effects of sodium on blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> No more than 1 drink per day for women and 2 for men. Reducing heavy alcohol consumption can lower systolic blood pressure by 2-4 mmHg.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACE inhibitors:</strong> (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril) — Block the enzyme that narrows blood vessels. First-line treatment, especially for patients with diabetes or kidney disease.</p>
                    <p><strong>ARBs:</strong> (losartan, valsartan, olmesartan) — Block angiotensin receptors to relax blood vessels. Often used when ACE inhibitors cause side effects like a dry cough.</p>
                    <p><strong>Calcium channel blockers:</strong> (amlodipine, nifedipine) — Relax blood vessel walls by preventing calcium from entering muscle cells. Effective as first-line therapy, especially in older adults.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thiazide diuretics:</strong> (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) — Reduce blood volume by increasing urinary output. Often used in combination with other medications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Most patients with stage 2 hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) will need two or more medications to reach target blood pressure. Medication decisions should be individualized with your physician.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                    <p><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Losing even 5-10 pounds can lower blood pressure. For every 1 kg of weight lost, blood pressure drops by approximately 1 mmHg.</p>
                    <p><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress contributes to sustained blood pressure elevation. Evidence-based techniques include mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep apnea is a common and underdiagnosed cause of resistant hypertension — talk to your doctor if you snore heavily or feel unrested.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> While smoking causes acute blood pressure spikes, the greater risk is accelerated arterial damage. Quitting smoking is one of the single best things you can do for cardiovascular health.</p>
