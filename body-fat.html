                <h2>The Science</h2>
                <p>Body fat percentage is a more accurate indicator of health risk than body weight or BMI alone. Research shows that excess body fat -- particularly visceral fat surrounding your organs -- is independently associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction. Unlike BMI, which cannot distinguish between muscle and fat, body fat percentage directly measures what actually drives metabolic risk.</p>

                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>Body fat percentage is not just a vanity metric -- it is a meaningful predictor of disease risk and longevity. The research on body composition and health outcomes is extensive and consistent.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Mortality Risk:</strong> Jayedi et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 35 prospective cohort studies covering 923,295 participants and 68,389 deaths. They found that each 10% increment in body fat was associated with an 11% increase in all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20). The relationship was J-shaped, with the lowest risk observed around 25% body fat.<sup>[1]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Superior to BMI:</strong> A 2025 study in the Annals of Family Medicine using NHANES data found that body fat percentage and waist circumference showed stronger associations with all-cause mortality over a 15-year period compared with BMI (P &lt; .01 vs P = .05). BMI misclassifies muscular individuals as overweight and fails to identify "normal weight obesity" -- people with normal BMI but elevated body fat who face significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Visceral Fat Drives Disease:</strong> A position statement published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology (Neeland et al., 2019) established that visceral adipose tissue is an independent risk marker of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Visceral fat releases pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids that worsen insulin resistance and accelerate atherosclerosis, making it far more dangerous than subcutaneous fat.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Metabolic Syndrome and Insulin Resistance:</strong> Research shows that body fat percentage is a strong indicator of insulin resistance even in people with normal BMI. Kim et al. (2018) found that high fat / low muscle body composition was associated with significantly higher insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome prevalence, while individuals with normal weight obesity had six times greater risk for metabolic syndrome than those without.<sup>[4]</sup></li>

        <!-- HOW TO MEASURE -->

                <h2>How to Measure</h2>
                <p>The most practical way to track your body fat percentage at home is with a <strong>digital body fat scale</strong> (also called a bioelectrical impedance scale or smart scale). These scales send a small electrical current through your body to estimate body fat percentage along with your weight.</p>

                    <div class="method">
                        <h3>Daily Weigh-Ins on a Digital Body Fat Scale</h3>
                        <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Consumer body fat scales can be off by +/- 5% compared to gold-standard methods like DEXA scans. However, absolute accuracy is not the point. What matters is <strong>directional accuracy</strong> -- if you weigh yourself at the same time of day under the same conditions, the trend over time will reliably tell you whether your body fat is going up, going down, or staying the same.</p>
                        <p><strong>Protocol:</strong> Weigh yourself every morning, immediately after waking and using the bathroom, before eating or drinking anything. Wear minimal clothing or none. Stand on the scale with bare feet on the electrodes and record the result. The same conditions each day eliminate the variables that cause daily fluctuations (hydration, meals, clothing).</p>
                        <p><strong>Why Daily:</strong> Body weight and body fat readings fluctuate day to day due to water retention, sodium intake, glycogen stores, and other factors. A single measurement on any given day is unreliable. By weighing daily, you can look at the <strong>weekly average</strong>, which smooths out these fluctuations and gives you a much more accurate picture of the real trend. If your weekly average is decreasing, you are losing fat. If it is increasing, you are gaining fat. It's that simple.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to Buy:</strong> Any reputable digital body fat scale in the $25-50 range will work. Look for one that measures body fat percentage via bioelectrical impedance. Popular options include scales from Withings, Renpho, and Eufy. Scales that sync to a phone app make it easy to track your weekly averages over time.</p>
