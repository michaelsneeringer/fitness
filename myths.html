                <h2>The Problem with Fad Diets</h2>
                <p>The fitness industry thrives on selling quick fixes and magic solutions. But the research is clear: these approaches don't optimize the metrics that actually matter for long-term health.</p>

                <h2>Common Myths Debunked</h2>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Avoiding specific foods (gluten, dairy, seed oils) will transform your health</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Unless you have a specific medical condition (celiac disease, lactose intolerance), eliminating food groups won't meaningfully impact your strength, VO2 max, LDL, blood pressure, or body fat percentage.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Total caloric intake, adequate protein, whole food quality, and overall dietary patterns.</p>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Keto/Paleo/Carnivore diets are superior for fat loss</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> When protein and calories are controlled, no diet shows superior fat loss outcomes. The "best" diet is the one you can sustain while meeting your protein needs and maintaining a caloric deficit.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Caloric deficit, high protein intake, and adherence.</p>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Detoxes and cleanses improve metabolic health</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Your liver and kidneys handle detoxification. Juice cleanses and detox teas don't improve LDL, blood pressure, or body composition. They often result in muscle loss and metabolic slowdown.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Consistent healthy eating, adequate hydration, and supporting organ function through overall lifestyle.</p>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Cardio is all you need for fitness</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While cardio improves VO2 max, it doesn't build significant strength or muscle mass. You need resistance training to optimize strength and body composition.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training are essential for comprehensive health.</p>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Supplements can replace proper training and nutrition</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most supplements have minimal impact compared to training, diet, and sleep. Fat burners, BCAAs, and most pre-workouts won't move the needle on the metrics that matter.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Progressive resistance training, adequate protein, caloric balance, and recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Myth: You can spot reduce fat</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Doing endless crunches won't reduce belly fat. Fat loss happens systemically based on genetics and overall caloric deficit.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Total body fat reduction through caloric deficit and resistance training to maintain muscle.</p>

                <div class="myth-item">
                    <h3>Myth: Eating frequently "boosts metabolism"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Meal frequency doesn't significantly impact metabolic rate or fat loss when total calories and protein are equal. Eat on whatever schedule works for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Total daily calories and protein intake, not timing.</p>

                <h2>Focus on What Works</h2>
                <p>Instead of chasing trends, focus on the fundamentals that actually optimize your health metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Progressive resistance training</strong> 2-4x per week for strength</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardiovascular exercise</strong> for VO2 max improvement</li>
                    <li><strong>Adequate protein intake</strong> (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight)</li>
                    <li><strong>Caloric balance</strong> appropriate for your goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent sleep</strong> (7-9 hours nightly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Stress management</strong> for blood pressure and overall health</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular monitoring</strong> of your key metrics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These aren't sexy. They don't sell books or supplements. But they're what the science consistently shows actually works.</p>
