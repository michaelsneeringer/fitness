                <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>Reducing LDL cholesterol requires a multi-faceted approach. The following evidence-based strategies are listed in order of typical impact, though individual results vary. Always work with your healthcare provider to determine the right combination for you.</p>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reduce saturated fat:</strong> Replace saturated fats (red meat, full-fat dairy, butter) with unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados). This alone can lower LDL by 5-10%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Increase soluble fiber:</strong> Aim for 10-25g of soluble fiber daily from oats, beans, lentils, fruits, and vegetables. Each 5-10g of soluble fiber reduces LDL by roughly 5%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Add plant sterols and stanols:</strong> Consuming 2g per day of plant sterols or stanols (found in fortified foods or supplements) can lower LDL by 6-15%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adopt a Mediterranean-style diet:</strong> Emphasize whole grains, legumes, fish, fruits, vegetables, and olive oil. This dietary pattern is consistently associated with lower cardiovascular events.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eliminate trans fats:</strong> Avoid partially hydrogenated oils entirely. Even small amounts of trans fats raise LDL and lower HDL.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Exercise</h3>
                    <p><strong>Aerobic exercise:</strong> 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming). Regular aerobic exercise can lower LDL by 5-10% and raise HDL by 3-6%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resistance training:</strong> 2-3 sessions per week. While the direct effect on LDL is modest, resistance training improves overall metabolic health and body composition, which indirectly supports lipid management.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                    <p><strong>Statins:</strong> The first-line medication for LDL reduction. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg) can lower LDL by 50% or more. Statins have decades of evidence showing reduced cardiovascular events and mortality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ezetimibe:</strong> Blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Lowers LDL by an additional 15-20% when added to a statin. Recommended as second-line therapy.</p>
                    <p><strong>PCSK9 inhibitors:</strong> Injectable medications (evolocumab, alirocumab) that can lower LDL by 50-60% on top of statin therapy. Reserved for high-risk patients or those who cannot tolerate statins.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bempedoic acid:</strong> A newer oral option that lowers LDL by 15-25%. Can be used in patients with statin intolerance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Supplements</h3>
                    <p><strong>Psyllium husk:</strong> 5-10g daily can reduce LDL by 5-10%. A well-studied soluble fiber supplement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids:</strong> While primarily used to lower triglycerides, high-dose omega-3s (2-4g EPA/DHA) may have modest LDL-lowering effects in some individuals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Supplements should complement, not replace, dietary changes and medications when indicated. Many popular supplements (garlic, red yeast rice, niacin) have limited or inconsistent evidence for meaningful LDL reduction.</p>
