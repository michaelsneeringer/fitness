                <div class="key-findings">
                    <h3>The Data</h3>
                    <p>Individuals with LDL cholesterol below 70 mg/dL have roughly one-fifth the cardiovascular disease risk over 10 years compared to those above 190 mg/dL. The relationship is dose-dependent -- every reduction in LDL translates to proportionally lower risk. Because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, this directly impacts all-cause mortality: the CTT meta-analysis of 170,000 participants found that each 1 mmol/L (~39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol reduced all-cause mortality by approximately 10%.<sup>[2][4]</sup></p>

                    <h3>The Studies</h3>
                    <p>LDL cholesterol is not merely a risk marker -- it is a direct, causal driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The evidence is overwhelming and comes from genetic studies, epidemiological data, and randomized controlled trials.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Causal Role in Atherosclerosis:</strong> A 2017 consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society, synthesizing data from genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies involving over 2 million participants and more than 20 million person-years of follow-up, concluded that LDL directly causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is not a correlation -- it is a causal relationship supported by every major line of biomedical evidence.<sup>[1]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Dose-Dependent and Cumulative Risk:</strong> The Prospective Studies Collaboration analyzed individual data from 61 prospective studies covering nearly 900,000 adults and 55,000 vascular deaths. They found that each 1 mmol/L (approximately 39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with a roughly 20-25% proportional reduction in cardiovascular mortality. The relationship is log-linear: the lower the LDL, the lower the risk, with no evidence of a threshold below which benefits disappear.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Consistent Benefit Across Interventions:</strong> Silverman et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis published in JAMA examining data from 34 randomized trials involving over 270,000 participants. They found that every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol -- regardless of the drug mechanism used (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants) -- produced a consistent and proportional reduction in major cardiovascular events, confirming that the benefit comes from lowering LDL itself, not from any specific drug effect.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                        <li><strong>Intensive Lowering Saves More Lives:</strong> The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials with over 170,000 participants demonstrated that more intensive LDL-lowering therapy produced significantly greater reductions in major vascular events compared to less intensive therapy. Each additional 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol reduced major vascular events by about 22% per year, regardless of baseline LDL level.<sup>[4]</sup></li>

                <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>Reducing LDL cholesterol requires a multi-faceted approach. The following evidence-based strategies are listed in order of typical impact, though individual results vary. Always work with your healthcare provider to determine the right combination for you.</p>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reduce saturated fat:</strong> Replace saturated fats (red meat, full-fat dairy, butter) with unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados). This alone can lower LDL by 5-10%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Increase soluble fiber:</strong> Aim for 10-25g of soluble fiber daily from oats, beans, lentils, fruits, and vegetables. Each 5-10g of soluble fiber reduces LDL by roughly 5%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Add plant sterols and stanols:</strong> Consuming 2g per day of plant sterols or stanols (found in fortified foods or supplements) can lower LDL by 6-15%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adopt a Mediterranean-style diet:</strong> Emphasize whole grains, legumes, fish, fruits, vegetables, and olive oil. This dietary pattern is consistently associated with lower cardiovascular events.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eliminate trans fats:</strong> Avoid partially hydrogenated oils entirely. Even small amounts of trans fats raise LDL and lower HDL.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Exercise</h3>
                    <p><strong>Aerobic exercise:</strong> 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming). Regular aerobic exercise can lower LDL by 5-10% and raise HDL by 3-6%.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method">
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                    <p><strong>Statins:</strong> The first-line medication for LDL reduction. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg) can lower LDL by 50% or more. Statins have decades of evidence showing reduced cardiovascular events and mortality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ezetimibe:</strong> Blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Lowers LDL by an additional 15-20% when added to a statin. Recommended as second-line therapy.</p>
                    <p><strong>PCSK9 inhibitors:</strong> Injectable medications (evolocumab, alirocumab) that can lower LDL by 50-60% on top of statin therapy. Reserved for high-risk patients or those who cannot tolerate statins.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bempedoic acid:</strong> A newer oral option that lowers LDL by 15-25%. Can be used in patients with statin intolerance.</p>
